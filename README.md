# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gary Moon!
I'm a **mathematician** with expertise in **nonlinear PDE, applied analysis, fluid dynamics and free boundary problems**.

Currently, I'm working to rapidly expand my skills in **quantitative finance, numerical methods and machine learning**.

# Areas of interest:
## **Pure Mathematics**
- Nonlinear pde and free boundary problems
- Mathematical fluid dynamics: water waves and other free-surface flows
- Convex integration
- Applied analysis and mathematical modeling
## **Quantitative Finance**
- Asset valuation, derivative pricing, financial modeling
- Statistical arbitrage, high-frequency trading
- Applications of machine learning to quantitative finance
## **Numerical Analysis**
- Finite difference methods, spectral methods, Monte Carlo methods
- Finite element methods, finite volume methods, CFD
- Numerical optimization, numerical integration
## **Machine Learning**
- Supervised learning (regression, classification)
- Deep learning, neural networks, GANs, transformers, CNNs and computer vision, reinforcement learning
- Data analysis: Data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis/modeling, postprocessing and data visualization

# Some things I'm currently working on:
- **Enhancing Python coding skills**: focused on scientific computing, data analysis and machine learning.
- **Exploring machine learning**: interested to really get into deep learning.
